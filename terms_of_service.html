        including any new features and applications, and the Site, the "Services"), subject to the
        following Terms of Service (as amended from time to time, these "Terms of Service"). We

        which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or
        suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must
        have materially affected his settlement with the debtor." If you are a resident of another
        jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.</p>
