        <p>Welcome to the website (the "Site") of Fundinghub.io. This Site and online service is operated
                by Alimi Fin Market BDA Funding Hub ("we," "us" and/or "our") and has been created to
                provide information to our visitors ("you," "your") about our company and our online content,
                tools and services related to consumer lending and debt, whether such content, tools and services
                are accessed on the Site or through third-party websites, mobile sites and/or applications
                (together with the Site, the "Services"). This Privacy Policy describes how Funding Hub collects,
                uses and discloses information from visitors to the Services, including personally identifiable
                data ("Personal Data"). Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before using or
                submitting information through the Services. By using or submitting information through the
                Services, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy.<br><br>
                </p>
        <p class="desc-title">Information We Collect</p>
        <p>When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other
                information from you, as further described below:<br><br></p>
        <p><span class="desc-strong">Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services:</span> We collect Personal Data from you
                when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you access, complete and/or use
                one of our online forms, tools or content items, contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our
                surveys, register for access to the Services or use certain Services. If you complete one of our
                online forms, you will be asked to provide Personal Data such as your email address, first and
                last name, street address (including zip code), telephone number, date of birth and social security
                number. We also may collect information from you through the Services about your occupation,
                income, estimated credit score and the purpose and amount of the desired loan to assist in
                identifying potential loan products. Wherever Funding Hub collects Personal Data, we make an
                effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.<br><br>
                For clarity, Funding Hub collects Personal Data from you to, in part, provide you with
                personalized content and information related to loan products, but Funding Hub is not a lender.
                Any loan or related product to which you may become a party is solely transacted between you
                and the applicable lender and/or loan originator and is not a part of the Services.
                By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance
                with this Privacy Policy. You represent that the Personal Data you provide is true, accurate,
                current and complete, and that you have the authorization to provide it to us. If you provide
                Personal Data to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be
                transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Funding Hub and the
                authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.<br><br></p>
        <p><span class="desc-strong">IP Addresses & Device ID Information:</span> The requests you make to Funding Hub may contain
                your IP address (the Internet address of your computer). We may use your IP addresses for
                various purposes, including to display customized content and analyze and report upon usage of
                the Services; to diagnose and prevent service or technology problems affecting the Services; and
                to monitor and prevent fraud and abuse. If you access the Services on a mobile device, we may
                also collect your device identification number and request access to settings and location
                information for similar purposes and to personalize your experience with the Services.<br><br></p>
        <p><span class="desc-strong">Non-Identifiable Data:</span> When you interact with Funding Hub through the Services, we receive
                and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected
                passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. We
                may store such information ourselves or such information may be included in databases owned
                and maintained by Funding Hub affiliates, agents or service providers. The Services may use
                such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of
                visitors to the Services, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of
                our visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available
                or used in this process.<br><br>
                In operating the Services, we may use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies. A cookie
                is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when
                you access the Services. Cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services, customize
                users' experiences with the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately for
                research, advertising and marketing purposes. On most web browsers, you will find a "help"
                section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification
                when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave
                cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Services' features.<br><br>

                In addition to cookies, we may use web beacons (also known as "clear GIFs") to measure traffic
                to or from or use of our online forms, tools or content items and related browsing behavior and to
                improve your experience when using the Services. We may also use customized links or other
                similar technologies to track hyperlinks that you click and associate that information with your
                Personal Data in order to provide you with more focused communications.<br><br>

                This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies, web beacons and similar technologies by Funding
                Hub only. Uses of these technologies by third-party advertisers or websites linked from the
                Services, including third parties with which we partner, are governed by each such advertiser or
                website's privacy policy.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p><span class="desc-strong">Aggregated Personal Data:</span> In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the
                    Services, Funding Hub often conducts research on our customer demographics, interests and
                    behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be
                    compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Funding Hub may share this aggregate data
                    with our affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify
                    you personally. Funding Hub may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our
                    services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful
                    purposes.<br><br></p>
            <p class="desc-title">Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information</p>
            <p>Funding Hub uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy
                    Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in
                    connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email to
                    ask a question or report an issue with the Services, we will use the Personal Data you provide to
                    answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to
                    learn about loan products that may be available to you through third-party lenders and/or loan
                    originators, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with information on such loan
                    products and lenders and/or loan originators, to provide other personalized services, and/or to
                    monitor your use of the Services. Funding Hub and our subsidiaries and affiliates (the "Alimi Fin
                    Market Related Companies") may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-
                    identifiable information collected through the Services to help us improve the content and
                    functionality of the Services, to better understand our users and to improve the Services.<br><br></p>
            <p><span class="desc-strong">Marketing:</span> Funding Hub and Funding Hub's business partners with whom we share your
                    information for product pricing may use your Personal Data to communicate with you by email,
                    postal mail, phone call, or by text message to provide you with:<br><br>
                    - Information regarding your application status, or transactional information relevant to your
                    account.<br>
                    - Opportunities and promotions available through the services or products of our business
                    partners that we think may be of interest to you.<br>
                    - Information or content – such as articles or white papers – that we believe would be of interest
                    to you.<br><br>
                    We will send such communications only with your consent, which is gathered when you either
                    register for Funding Hub's services or sign up for future communications. Each marketing-
                    related communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of
                    receiving future marketing communications.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p class="desc-title">Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information</p>
            <p>Funding Hub is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to
                    be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which
                    we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set
                    forth below:<br><br></p>
            <p><span class="desc-strong">Certain Business Partners:</span> When we partner with other businesses to provide content or
                    services to you or to such business partners, we may share relevant Personal Data in connection
                    with such content or services. For example, we will share your contact and other information
                    with a lender or a loan originator if the information you provide in one of our online forms or
                    tools matches certain criteria for loan products offered by such lender and/or loan originator.
                    Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the
                    event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may
                    be part of the transferred assets.<br><br></p>
            <p><span class="desc-strong">Related Companies:</span> We may also share your Personal Data with the Alimi Fin Market Related
                    Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.<br><br></p>
            <p><span class="desc-strong">Agents, Consultants, and Related Third Parties:</span> Funding Hub, like many businesses,
                    sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of
                    such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and providing marketing
                    assistance. When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide
                    them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.<br><br></p>
            <p><span class="desc-strong">Legal Requirements:</span> Funding Hub may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law
                    or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii)
                    protect and defend the rights or property of Funding Hub, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to
                    protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal
                    liability.<br><br></p>
            <p class="desc-title">Your Choices</p>
            <p>You can visit the Services without providing any Personal Data. If you choose not to provide any
                    Personal Data, you may not be able to use certain features of the Services.<br><br></p>
            <p class="desc-title">Exclusions</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by Funding Hub other than
                    Personal Data collected through the Services. This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any
                    unsolicited information you provide to Funding Hub through the Services or through any other
                    means. This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the
                    Services, such as forums, any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and
                    other unsolicited submissions (collectively, "Unsolicited Information"). All Unsolicited
                    Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Funding Hub shall be free to reproduce,
                    use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without limitation or
                    attribution.<br><br></p>
            <p class="desc-title">Children</p>
            <p>Funding Hub does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you
                    are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Services. We
                    encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help
                    enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data on the
                    Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13
                    has provided Personal Data to Funding Hub through the Services, please contact us, and we will
                    endeavor to delete that information from our databases.<br><br></p>
            <p class="desc-title">Links to Other Websites</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other
                    websites not operated or controlled by Funding Hub (the "Third Party Sites"). The policies and
                    procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the Services
                    do not imply that Funding Hub endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest
                    contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.<br><br></p>
            <p class="desc-title">Security</p>
            <p>Funding Hub takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Services from
                    loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet
                    or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from the
                    Services may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information
                    you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to Funding
                    Hub via the Internet.<br><br>
                    
                    By using the Services or providing Personal Data to us, you agree that we may communicate
                    with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use
                    of the Services. If we learn of a security system's breach, we may attempt to notify you
                    electronically by posting a notice on the Services or by sending an email to you. You may have a
                    legal right to receive this notice in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or
                    to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice), please notify us at
                    Underwriting@fundinghub.io.<br><br></p>
            <p class="desc-title">International Users</p>
            <p>All Personal Data is stored on servers in the United States and is subject to United States law. By
                    choosing to use the Services or otherwise provide information to us, you agree that any dispute
                    over privacy or the terms contained in this Privacy Policy will be governed by the law of the
                    state of Colorado.Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, or the
                    breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration
                    Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the
                    arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The seat or place of
                    arbitration shall be Las Vegas, NV, USA.<br><br>
                    
                    If you are visiting the Services from the European Union or other regions with laws governing
                    data collection and use, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your information to
                    the United States and the global processing of such information. By providing your information
                    you consent to any transfer and processing in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br><br></p>
            <p class="desc-title">Changes to Funding Hub's Privacy Policy</p>
            <p>The Services and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be
                    necessary for Funding Hub to make changes to this Privacy Policy. Funding Hub reserves the
                    right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior
                    notice. Please review this policy periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal
                    Data. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of
                    the Services after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement
                    with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy.<br><br></p>
            <p><span class="desc-strong">New Uses of Personal Data:</span> From time to time, we may desire to use Personal Data for uses not
                    previously disclosed in our Privacy Policy. If our practices change regarding previously collected
                    Personal Information in a way that would be materially less restrictive than stated in the version
                    of this Privacy Policy in effect at the time we collected the information, we will make reasonable
                    efforts to provide notice and obtain consent to any such uses as may be required by law.<br><br></p>
